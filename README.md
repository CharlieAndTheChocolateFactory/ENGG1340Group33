# Game Description and Rules

  A random maze constructed by ASCII characters is generated by each time the program runs. The player can use keyboard input to control the character movement to find its way out of the maze. 
  Once the player finds the way out, the program will generate the most efficient solution of the maze. If the player decides to give up, he could also input special command to terminate the current trial and request for the solution given by the system.

# Features

1. The maze is generated randomly using a algorithm. The maze (game sets) genarated each time the program executes will be different.
2. Vector of integers will be used to store the maze.
3. The system will record the player's movement by a vector of integers. There will be a function for replaying the attempted moves.
4. The system will provide the functionality to save/load the game, including the maze itself and the movement history. The player can opt to save the game into a file and quit the system, the file can be reloaded to continue the game.
5. The program will be divided into several files, different components will be saved into corresponding files. 
6. Moveable character and the wall of the maze might be decorated with suitable fonts.
