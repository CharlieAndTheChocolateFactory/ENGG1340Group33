Game Description and rules

A random maze constructed by ASICII character is generated by each time the programme run. The player can use keyboard input to control the character movement to find its way out of the maze. 
Once the player found the way out, the programme will generate the shortest solution of the maze. Meanwhile, if the player decides to give up ,he could also input special command to terminate and request solution from the system.
Moveable character and the wall of the maze might be decorated with suitable font. 

Features

1.The maze is generated using algorithm aimed at producing random maze. The maze(game sets) of each time the program execute will be different.
2.2D arrays will be use to store the characters that make up the wall. 
3.The system will record the players movement. Once the player exit the game, The player could recover the position he moved when he reenter the game. We will deploy a vector to store the users path. Since vectors, unlike array, could change their size of during runtime. storing the steps that the player moved is henece feasible. 
4.The Saving and loading of the game status will involve file I/O.
5.The program will break up into several files, including a file with struct
