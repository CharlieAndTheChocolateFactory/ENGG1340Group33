# Game Description and rules

A random maze constructed by ASCII characters are generated by each time the programme run. The player can use keyboard input to control the character movement to find its way out of the maze. 
Once the player found the way out, the programme will generate the most efficient solution of the maze. Meanwhile, if the player decides to give up ,he could also input special command to terminate and request solution from the system.
Moveable character and the wall of the maze might be decorated with suitable font. 

# Features

1. The maze is generated using algorithm aimed at producing random maze. The maze(game sets) of each time the program execute will be different.
1. vector of vector of integer will be used to store the maze.
1. The system will record the players movement into a vector of integer. There will be a function of replay the playing history.
1. The system will provide the functionality to save/load the game, including the maze itself and the movement history. Please can opt to save the game into a file and quit the system. Player can load the saved file to continue the game.
3. The program will break up into several files, different components will be saved into corresponding files.
